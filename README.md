# React Query Learning Repository  

This repository showcases my journey of learning React Query, a library for managing server-state in React applications. It includes implementations and examples of the following key concepts:  

- **useQuery Hook**: For fetching and caching data efficiently.  
- **useMutation Hook**: For handling data mutations like create, update, and delete operations.  
- **useQueryClient**: For programmatic cache management and updates.  
- **Pagination**: Demonstrating efficient pagination techniques using React Query.  
- **Infinite Scrolling**: Implementing infinite scroll functionality with React Query.  
- **Dynamic Routing**: Exploring integration with dynamic routes in React applications.
